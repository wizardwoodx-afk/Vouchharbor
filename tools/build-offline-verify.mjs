/**
 * V11.7.1 — the offline verification pack.
 *
 * The 11.7. review could not certify the runtime test result from the shipped zip: it has
 * no node_modules, its environment could not `npm ci` offline, and bare `tsc --noEmit`
 * dies on missing React types before it produces a usable exit code. This tool answers
 * that caveat at the pack level: it pre-bundles EVERY probe suite (except its own
 * verifier, suite #40) into one self-contained .mjs per suite — no npm packages needed
 * at runtime, only Node — and writes verify/suites/ plus verify/MANIFEST.json (a sha256
 * per bundle). Anyone can then reproduce the full gate from the extracted zip:
 *
 *     node verify/run.mjs
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - The suite list comes from tools/probe-list.mjs, the SAME module `npm test` uses —
 *    the pack and the dev gate cannot drift apart.
 *  - MJ_ROOT is defined as "." and verify/run.mjs runs each bundle with cwd = the tree
 *    root, so the pack works from any extraction path (the dev runner instead bakes the
 *    absolute checkout path at build time).
 *  - Packages are bundled IN (the dev runner keeps them external for react); the one
 *    wrinkle is react-dom/server, a CommonJS package that require()s node builtins —
 *    the banner gives ESM output a real require (the well-known esbuild recipe; without
 *    it the v10Page suite dies on "Dynamic require of 'stream' is not supported").
 *  - probe/offlinePack.test.ts (suite #40) is deliberately NOT packed: it is the
 *    freshness gate for this pack itself (it rebuilds every bundle and byte-compares
 *    against the shipped ones), which only means something where the dev toolchain
 *    exists. Under `npm test` it runs; packed, it would only re-run the other suites.

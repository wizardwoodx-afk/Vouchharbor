/**
 * VOUCH HARBOR — reproducible drill benchmark (16.6.0).
 *
 * Customer-facing evidence: a machine-readable report of the full drill
 * catalog run through the REAL Mission Loop, with a single stable
 * overallDigest. The same discipline as the offline pack and the MCP
 * engine bundle: build with the project's own esbuild (JS API — no shell,
 * no .bin resolution, cross-platform), run the bundle, done.
 *
 *   node tools/drill-benchmark.mjs              → JSON on stdout
 *   node tools/drill-benchmark.mjs --out f.json → also writes f.json
 *
 * probe/drill.test.ts pins the CLI: it must run, emit the report schema,
 * carry the honest verdicts (guard passed / maths passed / impossible
 * failed), and its per-scenario attestations must match the in-process
 * drill attestations (cross-process reproducibility).
